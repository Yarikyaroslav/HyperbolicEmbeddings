# HyperbolicEmbeddings

# README.md for Hyperbolic Laplacian Experimentation

## Overview

This document serves as a guide for the Jupyter notebook containing several key functions related to the exploration and application of the hyperbolic Laplacian in graph theory. The notebook focuses on decision trees, examining how hyperbolic geometry can be applied to graph analysis and embedding.

## Functions Included

### 1. `create_adjacency_matrix(tree)`

- **Description**: Constructs an adjacency matrix in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format from a given decision tree.
- **Input**:
  - `tree`: A decision tree structure, typically obtained from a trained decision tree model.
- **Output**: 
  - A CSR matrix representing the adjacency matrix of the tree.

### 2. `laplacian_eigenmaps(adjacency_matrix, embed_dim, norm_laplacian=False)`
- This function originates from the seminars.
- **Description**: Computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix for a given adjacency matrix. This function is used for embedding graphs in a lower-dimensional space.
- **Inputs**:
  - `adjacency_matrix`: The adjacency matrix of the graph in CSR format.
  - `embed_dim`: The embedding dimension, determining the number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to compute.
  - `norm_laplacian`: A boolean flag to determine whether to use a normalized Laplacian.
- **Output**: 
  - A tuple of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

### 3. `plot_graph_with_edges(eigvec1, eigvec2, adjacency_matrix, title='Graph with Edges')`

- **Description**: Visualizes the graph by plotting the nodes using the two different eigenvectors and drawing edges according to the adjacency matrix.
- **Inputs**:
  - `eigvec1`, `eigvec2`: Different eigenvectors for plotting the nodes in 2D.
  - `adjacency_matrix`: The adjacency matrix of the graph.
  - `title` (optional): The title for the plot.
- **Output**: 
  - A plot of the graph with nodes and edges, saved as a PNG file.

### 4. `hyperbolic_laplacian(adjacency_matrix, alpha)`

- **Description**: Creates a hyperbolic Laplacian matrix for a given graph represented by its adjacency matrix and a vector of alpha values.
- **Inputs**:
  - `adjacency_matrix`: The adjacency matrix of the graph in CSR format.
  - `alpha`: A vector of alpha values.
- **Output**: 
  - The hyperbolic Laplacian matrix in CSR format.

### 5. `hyperbolic_laplacian_eigenmaps(adjacency_matrix, alpha, embed_dim)`

- **Description**: Computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hyperbolic Laplacian matrix, which is useful for hyperbolic embeddings of the graph.
- **Inputs**:
  - `adjacency_matrix`: The adjacency matrix of the graph in CSR format.
  - `alpha`: A 1D numpy array of alpha values for the hyperbolic Laplacian.
  - `embed_dim`: The embedding dimension for the eigenvalue and eigenvector computation.
- **Output**: 
  - A tuple of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hyperbolic Laplacian matrix.

## Usage
